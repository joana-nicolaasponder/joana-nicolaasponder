### Hi there, I'm Joana (she/her) 👋

I used to think tech was out of reach, but everything changed when I worked on a hackathon project at Shopify. I realized the problem-solving skills I’d developed in my work were exactly what I needed to dive into coding. 💻

Now, I’m an aspiring Web Developer with a passion for empathy-driven solutions. I’m all about learning, growing, and embracing mistakes as stepping stones—something I picked up during my time as a comedy improviser. 🚀

Life has taken me through different countries and roles, making me adaptable and eager for new challenges. My journey into tech isn’t just about coding—it’s about combining creativity, problem-solving, and collaboration to make something meaningful.

### What I’m excited about:
- Growing as a developer with hands-on experience
- Collaborative projects that combine empathy and innovation
- Carving out my own unique path in this dynamic industry 🌍

### Open to Opportunities:
