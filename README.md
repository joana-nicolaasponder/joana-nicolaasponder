# 🌿 Hi, I’m Joana (she/her) 👋

My path into tech wasn't linear: 

🎭 I chased expression through acting and photography in NYC.  
🏬 I led retail operations and learned how systems support people.  
🎤 Improv cracked me open — teaching me the power of play and presence.  
💻 At Shopify, I saw how tech could empower users — and coding lit me up.

Now I'm a **Full Stack Developer** building production applications with 2+ years of hands-on experience. I specialize in React, TypeScript, and Node.js, creating digital tools that blend:

- **Intuitive Design** → user-focused interfaces and smooth interaction flows  
- **Scalable Architecture** → normalized databases, API integrations, and performance optimization  
- **Production Quality** → testing, monitoring, and maintaining systems that serve real users
