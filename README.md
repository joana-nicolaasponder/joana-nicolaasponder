### Hi there, I'm Joana (she/her) 👋

The tech world always felt out of reach because I thought I wasn't smart enough for it. But then, bam! I ended up at Shopify and worked on this hackathon project with some developers. It hit me that the way they tackled problems was just like how I dealt with issues for my merchants. That's when I realized I could totally learn coding. 💻

🌟 I'm all about empathy, authenticity, love soaking up knowledge, and have this natural knack for problem-solving. Life's taken me through different countries and cultures, making me pretty adaptable. Plus, my time as a comedy improviser taught me that failing is cool—it's all about embracing mistakes as opportunities for growth. 🚀

Now, my journey isn't just about personal growth; it's about diving into the tech scene with all I've got. I took a leap, swapped gears, and decided to become a **Full Stack Developer**. Why? Because I'm thirsty for hands-on learning, and I've got this itch to carve my own spot in the tech world. 🛠️

So, here I am, all pumped up for collaborative innovation in this ever-changing tech realm. I'm not just looking to fit in; I want to bring my unique, empathetic spin to the tech game. Let's make some waves and contribute something awesome to this dynamic tech world! 🌊
