# 🌿 Hi, I’m Joana (she/her) 👋

My path into tech wasn't linear: 

🎭 I chased expression through acting and photography in NYC.  
🏬 I led retail operations and learned how systems support people.  
🎤 Improv cracked me open — teaching me the power of play and presence.  
💻 At Shopify, I saw how tech could empower users — and coding lit me up.

Now I’m weaving those threads together as a developer and creative builder.  
I design digital tools that blend:

- **Expression** → interfaces and flows that feel intuitive and alive  
- **Systems** → clean architecture and scalable backend logic  
- **Play** → joyful touches that make tech more human

## 🛠️ What I’m building

- [**Backlog Explorer**](https://backlogexplorer.com) → a game-tracking app helping players reconnect with the games they already own  
- **Personal projects** → that support reflection, learning, and joyful creation  
- **Small games & experiments** → playful projects in PICO-8 and beyond

---

## 🌱 What I bring

- Resilience, curiosity, and adaptability from a zig-zagging creative career  
- A builder’s mindset → I learn fast, iterate with care, and ship with joy  
- A deep love of blending **design thinking, problem-solving, and storytelling**
